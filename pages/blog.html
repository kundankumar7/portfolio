          <p>So, you want to become a <strong>backend developer</strong> but don't have a computer science degree? Maybe you're switching careers, or you're just fascinated by how websites and apps work behind the scenes.
            The good news is that <strong>you don't need a degree to become a backend developer.</strong> Many successful developers are self-taught. The bad news? <strong> There are no shortcuts—</strong> it requires patience, consistency, and dedication. <br>
            This guide will give you a <strong>realistic, step-by-step roadmap</strong> to learn backend development from scratch—without feeling overwhelmed. Let's get started!
          </p>
          
          <!-- Section 1 Start -->
          <h2>1. Understanding Backend Development</h2>
          <p>
            Before diving into coding, it's essential to understand what backend development actually is.
            In simple terms, the <strong>backend</strong> is the "brain" of an application that processes requests, stores data, and ensures everything runs smoothly. While 
            <strong>frontend development</strong> deals with the visible parts of a website or app (buttons, animations, layouts), <strong>backend development</strong> focuses on what happens behind the scenes—databases, servers, APIs, and security.
            As a backend developer, you'll be responsible for: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Writing server-side logic that powers applications.</li>
            <li>Managing databases to store and retrieve data efficiently.</li>
            <li>Creating APIs that allow communication between the frontend and backend.</li>
            <li>Implementing security measures to protect user data.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Backend is the "brain" of an application, handling logic, databases, and APIs.</li>
            <li>It requires logical thinking, problem-solving, and patience.
              Understanding how frontend and backend interact is crucial.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Every backend developer works with databases because every application needs to store data. There are two main types:
          </p>

          <h3>A. SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases</h3> 
          <p>
            SQL databases store data in structured tables. They are best for applications requiring strict relationships between data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite</li>
            <li>Learn how to create tables, write queries, and perform joins.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>B. NoSQL Databases</h3>
          <p>
            NoSQL databases store data in flexible formats like JSON. They are ideal for applications needing scalability and fast performance.
          </p>

          <h2>4. APIs: The Bridge Between Frontend & Backend</h2>
          <p>
            APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different systems to communicate. Most modern applications rely on APIs to fetch or send data. As a backend developer, you need to master:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>REST APIs (The most common way to build APIs)</li>
            <li>GraphQL (An alternative, flexible API structure)</li>
            <li>Using Postman (A tool for testing APIs)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Project Idea: Build a simple API that returns weather data from a public API.</h3>
